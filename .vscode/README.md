# Debugging

In order to run the api in debug mode,  you will need to 
- open the folder as a workspace so that the `.vscode` directory can come into play. 
- Click the Debug symbol(looks like a bug with a slash through it). You should see a dropdown in the top of the newly opened menu with your options. Select `Debug API Server` and click the play symbol to the left. 
- A debuggable version of the api should start and you can add breakpoints to the code from within VSCode.
